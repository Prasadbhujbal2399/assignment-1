<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<p>. Mathematics is a subject of numbers, shapes, data, measurements and also logical activities. It has a huge scope in every
 field of our life, such as medicine, engineering, finance, natural science, economics, etc.
 </p> 
  <h2> Types of mathematics:</h2>
  <p> algebra, number theory, geometry and arithmetic.
   </p>
	<h3>1.algebra:</h3>
   <p><b>algebra</b>  is constructive in stating a mathematical equation and relationship by using letters or other symbols
   representing the entities. The unknown quantities in the equation can be solved through algebra..<p/>

 	<h3>2.number theory :</h3>
   <p> number theory is unsullied by any application". Such a view is no longer applicable to number theory.
   In 1974, Donald Knuth said "virtually every theorem in elementary number theory arises in a natural, motivated way in
   connection with the problem of making computers do high-speed numerical calculations"<p/>
